        <h1>I Created a Blog!</h1>
        <p>This is sort of like a test for my blog. I created my website with the help of HTML, CSS and a little JS.
            This is my first blog in my first website. This is not perticularly a blog in my opinion. I am just sharing my 
            expirence in it. In this blog I will tell about the whole process which I do to make this website and this blog.
        </p>
        <h2>How I created it?</h2>
        <p>So, I created the website by using HTML,CSS and JS. If you have any knowlidge about them just let me know about it.
           In the first step I simple create a home page with the help of HTML. After that I do some styling with CSS. which 
           include padding, color, text formate, etc.After that i simply add the links of my social network sites like Instagram,
           facebook, and also my GitHub account. I also added some lists which show my recommendations and the stuff i do and my hobbies etc.
        </p>
        <p>I also take some help from my friend. I also want to tell you about him. His name is Vidhu and he is my very good friend.
            I want to give him a shoutout for his hard work and thank him for helping me. He also have a website you can check it just bu clicking 
            on his name given below. 
        </p>
